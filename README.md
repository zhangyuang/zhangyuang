### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am experienced in TypeScript and Rust, and currently employed at WeChat. Prior to this, I worked at Alibaba, with a strong focus on open-source projects.

I have had the privilege of being a lecturer at the Beijing Node.js Party in 2020 and 2021, as well as the Shenzhen GIAC meeting in 2021 and 2022.

If my projects have been of assistance to you, consider sponsoring me to help me continue focusing on open-source programs. If you require one-on-one consultation, you can also sponsor me for that. Once you've made a payment, you can send me a private message on Zhihu or email me with a screenshot of the payment.
